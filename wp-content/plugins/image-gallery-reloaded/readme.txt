== Frequently Asked Questions  ==

**How do I add galleries to posts?**

Remember, Image Gallery Reloaded uses the default WordPress gallery.

* Write a new Post or edit an existent.
* Add images to the post via the default Upload/Insert >Add an Image.
* On the Add an Image popup click the Gallery tab, Click Insert Gallery and save the post.


**How to display thumbnail on top?**

* Select the "Classic | thumbnail on top" theme
* If you'd like to show the thumbnails outside of the main image, set `Main Image Top Margin` height to allow the required space.


**How to add links to image descriptions and captions**

Wordpress escapes the double quotes in image descriptions and captions.
Use Single quotes: `<a href='http://my-awsome-site.com'>My Awsome Site</a>`

**Help, gallery does not display images**

The gallery displays only selected images. This feature allows you to keep some of the attached images excluded from the gallery. This also means that if no images are selected, the gallery will not show up. To fix this issue with existing galleries:


1.   Go to your post and click the "Edit Gallery" button.
2.   At the top of the popup click "Include in Gallery: All" or select individual images
3.   Click "Save all Changes"
4.   Click "Update Gallery Setting"
5.   Click "Update" in the post's Publish meta box
