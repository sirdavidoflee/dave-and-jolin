The Post-Page-Associator enables you to attach posts to a page. This Plugin has been granted the "Famous Software" Award!


== Description ==

= LATEST NEWS! =
* [There is a PROFESSIONAL EDITION of this Plugin available now](http://wpplugins.com/plugin/247/associated-posts-pro)!
* Post-Page-Associator has been granted the "Famous Software" Award! [To the post &raquo;](http://download.famouswhy.com/post_page_associator/)

= Description =
As the name suggests the Post-Page-Associator enables you to attach posts to a page. You can select a set of posts by category, tag, author or you just select some posts explicitly. 


= Handling =
The handling is very easy. When you are going to edit a page you will see a box with the title "Associate posts with this page". There you can choose categories, tags, authors and posts which should attached to this page. Optionally you can set the number of posts which should be shown on the page and some more settings like the post order.


= It doesn't work! =
If you are wondering why there are no associated posts when you view the page I guess you aren't using PHP5. **Post-Page-Associator requires PHP5!**


= Settings =
You can change the association settings in WP Admin Panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; Associated Posts.


= ShortCode =
In case you won't have the associated posts at the end of your page you can use the <code>[associated_posts]</code> Shortcode anywhere in your pages content. So the posts will be shown at the place you inserted the ShortCode.
The old <code>[associated_posts enforce]</code> ShortCode is deprecated.


= Customization =
If you need a customized template of the associated posts. E.g. as list or with author, date, time or meta data feel free to send me an E-Mail. For a small fee I will write a customized template for you.


= How to write an own customization =
A template is a php file which renders the output of the associated posts (a WP Query). You can find example template files in the plugin folder (templates/). You can store these templates in:

* PPA plugin templates folder (or a sub folder) (inadvisable)
* your theme folder (or a sub folder)
* wp-content/ppa-templates/ (or a sub folder)

The default header of a PPA template looks like that:
<code>
/*
PPA Template: Example Template
Description: This is the description.
Version: 1.0
Author: Your name
Author URI: http://example.com
Author E-Mail: yourname@example.com
*/
</code>

The only required information in the header is the "PPA Template" line. So the Plugin knows this is a PPA Template.


= For Theme Designers =
If you want to integrate this plug-in in your theme you have to add a new file to your theme directory: *associated-posts.php*

The plugin will use your template to show the associated posts on pages by default. You can find a working example file of this template in the plug-in directory (*templates/title-excerpt-thumbnail.php*). Just copy it in your template directory and modify it until it fits in your theme.

If you want to disable the auto append feature of the plug-in you can use the '*associated_posts_auto_append*' filter.
Just add this line of code to your *functions.php*:
<code>
Add_Filter ('associated_posts_auto_append', Create_Function('',' return False; ') );
</code>


= For real developers ;) =
As a real developer you can easy access to the associated posts via functions:

<code>
wp_plugin_post_page_associator::get_associated_posts ($page_id = Null){
/* $page_id: the id of the page which associated posts you want to read.
             if $page_id = Null, the plugin will read from current page.
   
   return:   By default the function returns a WP_Query Object.
             The object is very well documented in the Codex.
             If there are no posts this function returns false.
*/
}

wp_plugin_post_page_associator::has_associated_posts ($deprecated = True){
/*

  This function is deprecated. I will remove it in future releases!

*/
}
</code>

Real developers love the clout of their code. And as a real WordPress developer you know about the magic of hooks and filters. The Post-Page-Associator uses a filter with the name '*associated_posts_template*'. You can use this filter to set the template file of the associated posts. (You can overwrite the users template option with this filter.) You can find an example file of this template in the plug-in directory (*templates/title-excerpt-thumbnail.php*).

If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment in my blog. But please think about this: I will not add features, write customizations or write tutorials for free. Please think about a donation. I'm a human and to write code is hard work.
